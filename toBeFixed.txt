Hack-y things:

FONTELLO:
fontello icons are imported, but referenced incorrectly.
Currently used like this: 
    <i class="fontello-icon">î Š</i> <--The rectangle character is a tick icon in this case
But should be something like this: 
    <i class="fontello-icon tick-icon"></i>
Or even this (as ionic does it):
    <fontello-icon name="tick-icon"></fontello-icon>
